Cloud is a general-purpose Java command dispatcher &amp; framework. It allows programmers to define command chains that are then parsed and invoked from user-supplied string inputs, to execute pre-defined actions.

Cloud commands consist out of deterministic chains of strongly typed arguments. When you define a command,
you know exactly what type of data you're going to be working with, and you know that there will be no
ambiguity at runtime. Cloud promotes writing reusable code, making it very easy to define new commands.

Cloud allows you to build commands in many different ways, according to your preferences:

Cloud is built to be very customisable, in order to fit your needs. You can inject handlers and processors
along the entire command chain. If the pre-existing command parsers aren't enough for your needs, you're easily
able to create your own parsers. If you use the annotation parsing system, you can also define your own annotations
and register them to further customise the behaviour of the library.

Cloud by default ships with implementations and mappings for the most common Minecraft server platforms, 
Discord4J, JDA4, JDA5, Kord and Javacord for
Discord bots, PircBotX for IRC and [cloud-spring](https://github.com/incendo/cloud-spring) for Spring Shell.
The core module allows you to use Cloud anywhere, simply by implementing the CommandManager for the platform of your choice.
