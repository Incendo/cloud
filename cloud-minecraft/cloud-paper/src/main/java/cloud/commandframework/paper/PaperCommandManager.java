     * Construct a new Paper command manager
     *
     * @param owningPlugin                 Plugin that is constructing the manager. This will be used when registering the
     *                                     commands to the Bukkit command map.
     * @param commandExecutionCoordinator  Execution coordinator instance. The coordinator is in charge of executing incoming
     *                                     commands. Some considerations must be made when picking a suitable execution
     *                                     coordinator. For example, an entirely asynchronous coordinator is not suitable
     *                                     when the parsers used in your commands are not thread safe. If you have
     *                                     commands that perform blocking operations, however, it might not be a good idea to
     *                                     use a synchronous execution coordinator. In most cases you will want to pick between
     *                                     {@link CommandExecutionCoordinator#simpleCoordinator()} and
     *                                     {@link cloud.commandframework.execution.AsynchronousCommandExecutionCoordinator}.
     *                                     <p>
     *                                     A word of caution: When using the asynchronous command executor in Bukkit, it is very
     *                                     likely that you will have to perform manual synchronization when executing the commands
     *                                     in many cases, as Bukkit makes no guarantees of thread safety in common classes. To
     *                                     make this easier, {@link #taskRecipe()} is provided. Furthermore, it may be unwise to
     *                                     use asynchronous command parsing, especially when dealing with things such as players
     *                                     and entities. To make this more safe, the asynchronous command execution allows you
     *                                     to state that you want synchronous command parsing.
     *                                     <p>
     *                                     The execution coordinator will not have an impact on command suggestions. More
     *                                     specifically, using an asynchronous command executor does not mean that command
     *                                     suggestions will be provided asynchronously. Instead, use
     *                                     {@link #registerAsynchronousCompletions()} to register asynchronous completions. This
     *                                     will only work on Paper servers. Be aware that cloud does not synchronize the command
     *                                     suggestions for you, and this should only be used if your command suggestion providers
     *                                     are thread safe.
     * @param commandSenderMapper          Function that maps {@link CommandSender} to the command sender type
